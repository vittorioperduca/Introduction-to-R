["index.html", "An Introduction to R Chapter 1 Welcome 1.1 Technical details", " An Introduction to R Vittorio Perduca (Université de Paris) September 2020 Chapter 1 Welcome This document is as a tutorial for self-learning the basic use of R. It was prepared for the students enrolled in the first year of the AIRE Life Sciences Master Program of the Centre de Recherche Interdisciplinaire at the Université de Paris. Although you will find an explanation of the basic objects and commands, this introduction is not a complete reference to the R language, so you will have to use the help and search for information on the web. Before moving on to the exercises at the end of each chapter, you are encouraged to type the commands and understand the result: the best way to learn a language is to write and debug lots of lines of code! 1.1 Technical details This document was written in RMarkdown with bookdown. It is both a website hosted on github and a text. This is a beta version, please report any issues at vittorio.perduca@u-paris.fr This work is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0 "]
